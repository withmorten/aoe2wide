1st parameter is the position in the file (of the first byte OUT OF 4)
2nd parameter is (if H, V, HV) the number found at that location or (if dH, dV) the resolution the number found at that pos is related to.
  e.g. 'last line number' or so would be 00010101 1024 dV 1023  (1023 is the last line number related to 1024 height). Will be patched to 1049 if newHeight = 1050, for example
3rd parameter:
 H is 'horizontal'
 V is 'vertical'
 HV is 'horizontal and vertical' (patched as vertical ... (sic) )
 dH is 'horizontal - related value' (follow by original value pls)
 dV is 'vertical - related value' (follow by original value pls)
 -prefix is 'commented out' version of the above (eg. -dH  because the GUI image is not yet horizontally scaled)
 X is 'not relevant'
 ? is 'not checked'
 * is candidate
   'Nothing' is same as ?
4th parameter is a comment OR (dH dV) the actual value (for checking, helps you prevent mistakes)
5+th parameter is comment
